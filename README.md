Plant Doctor expert system iPhone application

This was an early iPhone application from 2010. It lets the user input plant symptoms and it then attempts to use statistics or an expert system to diagnose the plant problem. If I were to write it now I'd use trees, but in 2010 it better than any of the other attempts out there.
